> Hello, world!

Greetings from far north of Brazil! My name is Nick Diego Yamane. I'm
originally from [Maués](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau%C3%A9s), a
small town that sits in the heart of the [Amazon
rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest). Since
2002, I live in [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus), from
where I work remotely for [Igalia](https://igalia.com), a spanish flat
worker-owned consultancy specialized in core open source technologies.
I'm part of its amazing Chromium team since 2018, along with other
talented [people](https://www.igalia.com/team/) spread around the world.

In this blog, my idea is to share stories about my daily job, which
should include mostly technical articles, e.g: in-depth dives into
coding, analysis and debugging tasks, hopefully using a pretty informal
language. However, expect also shorter and random stuff which are not
necessarily related to my work and may look more like microblogging
content.

For more frequent and short updates, keep an eye on my
[mastodon](https://social.coop/@nickdiego) and
[bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nickdiego.dev) profiles. You can also
reach out to me either by [mail](mailto:nickdiego@igalia.com) or over
[matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@nickdiego:igalia.com). In case you're
curious about Igalia inner workings, besides
[igalia.com](https://igalia.com), please check out this awesome
[talk](https://youtu.be/du7fC8VCbXg) by Valerie as well as the old but
gold Andy's [blog
post](https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/04/05/new-beginnings).
